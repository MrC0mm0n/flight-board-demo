# Flight Board Demo

## Requirements

Airport arrival and departure app - Create a web app that is able to read from a database of your choice and display incoming and outgoing
flights of a given airport. Below are the high-level requirements.
- The application should highlight delayed flights based on arrival/departure scheduled times and the current system time.
- Provide an admin view that allows for the insertion of new inbound and outbound flights.

Tech details
- The front end should be written in angular and extra points are given if the design is responsive.
- Create as a Spring Boot application
- Define a simple schema that allows for the listing of inbound and outbound flights. Include information you deem relevant. List any assumptions made etc

## Assumptions

- Based off [Toronto Pearson Airport (YYZ)](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/whats-happening/stories/whyyz/how-our-runways-work) average 1300 flights arrive or depart from Pearson each day
- Making a prototype based on YYZs flight board for [arrivals](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/arrivals) & [departures](https://www.torontopearson.com/en/departures)
- Using [global airlines & airports data](https://openflights.org/data.html) and [massaging](https://github.com/MrC0mm0n/flight-board-demo/tree/main/flight-board-demo-rest-api/data)
-
